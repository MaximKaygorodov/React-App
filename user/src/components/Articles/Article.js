Chicago's Famous Pizza Pot Pie Recipe Everyone knows the Chicago deep dish pizza but I doubt many people have heard of their other famous pie... the Pizza Pot Pie. It’s nowhere near as widespread as the classic deep dish but it definitely has a cult following.  When I stumbled across a video of the pizza potpie from Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder Co. I knew I needed to try and recreate it. Beyond the Loop - Lincoln Park: Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder - YouTubeFirst off what exactly is a pizza pot pie? Well, it’s a pizza in reverse that’s cooked in a bowl. However, we prefer to use an 8-in deep dish pizza pans instead of potentially staining or ruining a nice bowl. The sauce is also a little different; it’s essentially a meat sauce almost like a ragu or bolognaise. Very, different compared to a more traditional pizza sauce. The cheese, however, is what really makes this pizza famous. It stretches, it’s gooey and most important of all there is a lot of it.
