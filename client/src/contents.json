[{"title":"Violet: Grilled Pizza Perfection In The East Village","context":"Have you ever had grilled pizza before? If your answer is yes, then there is a good chance it was pizza that someone made for you on their home grill. But it’s unlikely that it resembled the phenomenal grilled pizza that’s currently being served at Violet (511 East 5th Street), the latest restaurant from the team behind Emily and Emmy Squared. Those two namesake spots I would consider to be pizza places that happen to serve some other notable dishes (like the well regarded Emmy Burger and Spicy Chicken Sandwich). The original Emily restaurant in Clinton Hill has 16 pizzas on its menu, while Willamsburg’s Emmy Squared outpost boasts 13 Detroit-style pies. But Violet offers a much more concise pizza menu — just six pies, served alongside a dozen other dishes including pastas and salads. It’s a restaurant that happens to serve some delicious grilled pizza. And you should try as many of them as possible.\n\n","time":"16.3.2019  10:53:7","id":9}]
