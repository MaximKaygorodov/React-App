I’d always hated the awkward small talk that accompanied these sorts of encounters, the feigned attempts that the exchange was anything but transactional. But it was different with Dphrepaulezz. He had an infectious positivity to him, one that seemed unbefitting of his circumstances and the challenges life had thrown his way.\n\nAs Dphrepaulezz busted out small bags of OG Kush, he told me of his past lives: a youth spent on the streets of Oakland, where he says he robbed homes and sold crack; a momentary brush with fame in the 1990s as a crooning R&B singer and self-taught multi-instrumentalist with a million-dollar record deal whose career and creativity foundered under the pressures of trying to make a hit; a near-fatal car crash in 1999 that put him in a coma and robbed him of his desire — and, for a time, his ability — to play music; and his retreat from the music world to his farm in Oakland, where he grew weed, raised chickens, and returned to hustling.\n\nThe birth of Dphrepaulezz’s son in 2009 inspired him to play music again. He co-founded an Oakland arts and music collective, Blackball Universe, to support struggling black artists. He also started busking at BART stations and on street corners. He went “fishing” in public places, observing the mundane everyday lives of others for material.\n\nIf Dphrepaulezz had any ambitions for the life of success that soon awaited him, he didn’t betray them in our meetings. I last saw him late that summer, after I was awarded a research fellowship to Harvard. A few days before leaving town, I hit him up for a last celebratory eighth. I had to meet him in his car, because he was in a rush. As we drove around the block, I couldn’t find my wallet. He told me not to worry about it, congratulated me on my fellowship, and handed me the bag of weed.\n\n“Just don’t forget about the little people when you make it big,” he said.\n\nOur paths diverged from there. I never “made it big” in quite the way I imagined or Dphrepaulezz predicted. But he did.\n\nIn 2014, Dphrepaulezz became Fantastic Negrito. One of his first songs, “Night Has Turned to Day,” triumphantly proclaimed that he had found his way out of the darkness. The spoils soon followed. In 2015, Dphrepaulezz beat out 7,000 contestants to win NPR’s Tiny Desk competition with a song that he and his bandmates recorded in one take in the freight elevator of a warehouse. Since then, he’s played sold-out shows and toured the world. His song “Working Poor” was embraced by Bernie Sanders and his supporters during his 2016 campaign; others have been licensed for television shows and movies. Along the way, Dphrepaulezz released two critically acclaimed and Grammy-winning albums, The Last Days of Oakland and Please Don’t Be Dead.","time":"9.3.2019  10:51:54","id":6}]
